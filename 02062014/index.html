  <h1>We're scouting for <br><i class="normal">troops to join the next mega-revolution.</i></h1>

  <p class="lead">Hey! I have good news for people that live in <span class="emphasize">Finland</span> and fit the bill below! We've kicked off yet another huge &amp; exciting undertaking with a trusted and seasoned team and we have now invitations to the party...</p>

  <p>We're looking for a sales-oriented self-starter to take on a huge opportunity with our supercharged FinTech startup that is still silently cruising in stealth mode. We‘re launching officially during fall 2014 and are now looking for savvy entrepreneurial spirits to claim their regions in commanding a fierce market-entry.  You have some years under your belt in running a startup or business unit and experience in managing a team of your own. You’re a natural spokesperson and take center stage whenever the opportunity calls. You’re described by others as engaging and inspiring and have a natural talent to get great people involved. You hail from a background of sales and experienced in indirect sales through partnerships, alliances and affiliates. We offer you an amazing opportunity to get a front row seat in the revolution of a massive 250 billion euro market and a solid equity plan to keep you amped.</p>

  <h4>Sounds like you?</h4>

  <p>First things first; this is no picnic position. If you're contemplating on contacting but you're not qualifying on all of the above - don't bother. This is a position that comes with great power and responsibility attached (and an equal upside to go along). You need to be comfortable in working together with an A-class team that will push at its peak performance and you will be off your comfort zone for sure.</p>
